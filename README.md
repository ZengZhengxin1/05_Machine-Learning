## Theoretical

Hung-yi Lee's [machine leaning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y87Ct23H3Kw&list=PLJV_el3uVTsNxV_IGauQZBHjBKZ26JHjd) on the youtube channel is really good for beginners.


## Coding

### Pytorch

Hongpu Liu's [PyTorch coding lesson](https://liuii.github.io/post/pytorch-tutorials/).

### Network for Image processing

Wu Zhe's [Deep learning for image processing](https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing).

### Sorce Code Analyzing

Deepth analysis into Sorce Code of PyTorch and advanced theses by [deep_thoughts](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ov411M7xL/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=22cbccb84a478cb5e4a28b6bcf11e6a0) in Bilibili.
